# Debugger-app
A lightweight, browser-based JavaScript Debugger that brings core debugging features — like breakpoints, step-through execution, call stack inspection, and variable watching — right into your own environment. Think of it as a simplified Chrome DevTools-style debugger built just for JavaScript developers.
